# Machine Learning Projects & Exercises

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, assignments, and working notebooks from coursework and personal exploration. It includes implementations of core ML algorithms, model evaluation techniques, and applied projects using real-world datasets. Topics covered range from supervised learning (e.g., regression, classification) to unsupervised methods (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), with additional focus on practical model tuning and data preprocessing.
